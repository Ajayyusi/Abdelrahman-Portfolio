# Smart Parking System – Graduation Capstone Project

**Goal:** Detect available parking spaces and vehicle types in real time and display them to users in an Android app.

**Tech stack:** YOLOv5 (computer vision), Python, Android, MySQL, Navicat

## What I built
- Trained a YOLOv5 model to detect cars, trucks, bikes and emergency vehicles from camera feeds.
- Developed an Android application that shows live parking availability based on the detection results.
- Stored detection results and parking status in a MySQL database and managed the schema using Navicat.
- Implemented simple analytics to monitor parking usage and support better parking management.
